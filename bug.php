In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not strictly numeric.  Consider this scenario:

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["1"] = "one";
$myArray[1] = "One";

echo count($myArray); // Outputs: 2
```

While seemingly straightforward, this exhibits unexpected behavior.  PHP treats the keys "1" and 1 as distinct. The count function correctly reflects two separate elements because string and integer keys are considered different.  This can lead to data loss or unexpected results if you're relying on implicit type coercion for array keys.

Another example:
```php
$data = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3];
foreach ($data as $key => $value) {
if ($key == 'b') {
    unset($data[$key]);
}
}

print_r($data); //Output: Array ( [a] => 1 [c] => 3 )
```
This is expected. However, if you try this:
```php
$data = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3];
foreach ($data as $value) {
if ($value == 2) {
    unset($data[$key]); // Notice we are using $key which is not defined in this loop
}
}

print_r($data); //Notice that this will throw an error, because $key is undefined in this context
```
This will cause an error because you are trying to unset an element with a key that is not defined.
